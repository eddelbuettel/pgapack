## About

PGAPack is a general-purpose, data-structure-neutral, parallel genetic
algorithm library developed at Argonne National Laboratory.

Key features are:

- Callable from Fortran or C.
- Runs on uniprocessors, parallel computers, and workstation networks.
- Binary-, integer-, real-, and character-valued native data types.
- Object-oriented data structure neutral design.
- Parameterized population replacement.
- Multiple choices for selection, crossover, and mutation operators.
- Easy integration of hill-climbing heuristics.
- Easy-to-use interface for novice and application users.
- Fully extensible to support custom operators and new data types.
- Extensive debugging facilities.
- A large set of example problems.
- It is released under the MPICH2 license (also used by the MPICH2 MPI implementation from Argonne National Laboratory).

## History

David Levine is the principal author of pgagpack and wrote most of the code
during the mid-1990s. Dirk Eddelbuettel became its Debian maintainer in 2008,
organised a relicensing by Argonne National Laboratories under the MPICH2
license and is currently also the effective upstream maintainer.
