This is the test directory README.

instverf:
--------

A simple program to test the accuracy of an installation.  It runs five
distinct genetic algorithms, and stores the results from each.  After all
five are run, it will compare the computed results to those known to be
correct, stored on disk as "instverf.data".  If any errors are found, the
problem number is reported.

The problems tested are
	0:	Binary datatype
	1:	Integer datatype
	2:	Character datatype
	3:	Real datatype
	4:	Binary datatype using PGAGetRealFrom*


SanityChecks:
------------

Contains several programs designed to test the sanity of PGAPack.  Under
normal circumstances, they should not be needed.  ST_* will call most
every PGAPack function.  PT_* will test the parallel code -- it must
be run with at least three processors!
This directory contains several programs that exist only to test the
sanity of PGAPack.  They are very useful for testing the fortran to C
interface, and that sending and receiving strings work.

ST_c.c and ST_f.f simply call (most) every function in PGAPack.  They
also run several GA's which do nothing other than use every type of
crossover and mutation for each native datatype.

PT_c.c and PT_f.f test high-level stuff.  It tests (not in this order) if
sending/receiving of strings works, PGARun, PGARunGM, PGARunIM and PGARunNM
(the last two aren't implemented yet, though), and a user defined
run routine.  A real version of MPI _MUST_ be used for PT_c and PT_f.

instverf.c will run several GA's, one for each native datatype, and check
the output computed versus that stored on disk.  If any differences are
found, it will give a warning.

These programs are the development testing suite.
