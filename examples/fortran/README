Seven example FORTRAN programs come with PGAPack.  What follows is a listing 
of the names of the programs and a brief description of their function.

classic.f  -- Optimizes one of Griewank;s test function, Rastrigin's test
              function, or Schwefel's test function.  All use a real valued
	      datatype.

dejong.f   -- This program optimizes one of the five functions from the DeJong
              test suite with a binary string as the chromosome.  Graycoding is
              an option.

example.f  -- An example from the User's Guide.

maxbit.f   -- A very simple example that maximizes the number of 1's in a
              binary string.  Does no I/O.

maxchar.f  -- Maximizes the number of z's in a character string.  Does I/O.

maxint.f   -- Maximizes the sum of all alleles in the gene.

name.f     -- Evolves a character string to match a hard-coded string.  Does
              no I/O, but shows how to use userfunctions InitString, Mutation,
              and Done.  Also uses an elitist model of evolution with no
              crossover.

namefull.f -- Same idea as above, but uses all native user defined functions.
