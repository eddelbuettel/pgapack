Eight example C programs come with PGAPack.  What follows is a listing 
of the names of the programs and a brief description of their function.

classic.c  -- Optimizes Griewank's, Rastrigin's or Schwefel's test function.
              All use a real valued datatype.  The problems are:
		1.  Griewank
		2.  Rastrigin
		3.  Schwefel

dejong.c   -- This program optimizes one of the five functions from the DeJong
              test suite with a binary string as the chromosome.  Graycoding is
              an option.

example.c  -- An example from the User's Guide.

maxbit.c   -- A very simple example that maximizes the number of 1's in a
              binary string.  Does no I/O.

maxchar.c  -- Maximizes the number of z's in a character string.  Does I/O.

maxint.c   -- Maximizes the sum of all alleles in the gene.

name.c     -- Evolves a character string to match a hard-coded string.  Does
              no I/O, but shows how to use userfunctions InitString, Mutation,
              and Done.  Also uses an elitist model of evolution with no
              crossover.

namefull.c -- Same idea as name.c, but uses all native user defined functions.

udtstr.c   -- Uses a user-defined datatype, a single structure.
